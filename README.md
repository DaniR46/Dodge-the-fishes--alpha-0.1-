# Dodge the Fishes 🐟

Welcome to **Dodge the Fishes**!
This is an endless arcade survival game developed with **Godot Engine 4**.

The goal is simple: dodge the fishes and survive as long as possible to set a new High Score!

## 🚀 About the Project
This is **my very first game project**.
I built this to learn the basics of game development, GDScript, and the Godot Engine. While the core gameplay is functional, I am constantly learning and looking for ways to improve my coding skills and game design.

**Constructive criticism, feedback, and advice are highly appreciated!** If you see something in the code that could be optimized or done better, please let me know.

## 🗺️ Roadmap & Future Updates
I plan to keep updating the game as I learn more. Here is what I am working on next:

- [ ] **Difficulty Selection:** Adding a menu to choose between *Easy, Medium, and Hard* modes.
- [ ] **HUD Improvements:** Polishing the User Interface for a better look.
- [ ] **New Enemies:** Adding more fish varieties with different behaviors.
- [ ] **Power-ups:** (Maybe?) Items to help the player survive longer.

**Have a suggestion for an update?**
I am open to ideas! Feel free to open an Issue or contact me if you have a cool concept for the game.
